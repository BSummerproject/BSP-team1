**Hello :wave: and Welcome**,
I am Dinaol Tadesse a Computer Engineering Graduate from Jackson State University. In one of the summer internships I participated, I was able to learn more about myself and what fuels and motivates me. On that summer project I learnt that I am very passionate in projects which are geared towards helping people. I want to create an impact in people's lives.


## EXPERIENCES:

### Personal Project - iOS Application
#### Fall 2019 - Summer 2020

Worked on an iOS application from front end to back end using **Google Firebase Auth** and **Firestore**. 
Submitted iOS app to the app store. 
I learnt valuable skills and experience.
The app is a **game** amongst two players where the goal is to find each-otherâ€™s hidden numbers and the first person to find the number wins the game. 
My inspiration for creating this app came from one of my favorite childhood games.

### Innovation Fellow - Jackson State University
#### Fall 2019 - Summer 2020

A leader Innovation Fellow at Jackson State University not only inspires creativity, but also teaches fellow students designing and game development, use **adobe creative cloud programs**, and **utilize 3D printing**. Guided students to cultivate and execute innovative projects. For instance one student engineered and 3D Designed a prototype of a pipe that filters water as it passes through it.

### Research Assistant - Indiana University
#### Fall 2019 - Summer 2020

A summer internship spent working with **microcontrollers** for developing and implementing direction indicator Exit signs. Implemented MQTT **IoT**(Internet of Things) connectivity protocol for the communication of the ESP32 device and the **MQTT** server. Built a GUI using **Node-Red** as framework along with Python and some JavaScript to format of incoming Data. Managed to program complete code for communication of the device to the server using **C++**.
I was inspired to work in this project as it has the capability of saving thousands of lives from accidents in case of an emergency evacuation.
